# Overview

August was a very slow month for RokuCommunity. Several core community contributors had some big family changes (see [baby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant) and [marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage)). We only merged 1 PR, [brighterscript#865](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/pull/865), but that wasn't even included in a release until September!


# Thank you
We just want to take this moment to say thank you to all of our awesome users. We build all of this software because we know the immense value that it brings to your developer experience. We appreciate your support and patience as we continue to innovate and support the RokuCommunity tools.
