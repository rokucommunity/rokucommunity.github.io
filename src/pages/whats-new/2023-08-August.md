# Overview

August was a very slow month for RokuCommunity. Several core community contributors had some big family changes (see [baby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant) and [marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage)).

Thankfully [@markwpearce](https://github.com/markwpearce) was hard at work on more BrighterScript type tracking changes! None of [these commits](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/commits/release-0.66.0?since=2023-08-01T00:00:00Z&until=2023-08-01T23:59:59Z) were included in a release until September, but it feels kind of silly to have a "whats new" for August that doesn't at least link to some code...
