# Debugging
## Allow relative RALE tracker task path
The RALE tracker task path can now be a relative path, and supports replacement variables like `${workspaceFolder}`

## Execute complex REPL expressions in the Run & Debug panel
Now the Watch section of the Run & Debug panel supports complex REPL expressions. This means you can now execute expressions like `doSomething()` or `"alpha" + chr(3)`.

> Note that this only works if you have the Debug Protocol enabled.

## Fix infinite spin for unloaded vars
Fix a bug where the UI would spin forever when trying to load variables that no longer exist. Now we show a useful error message.

Before:

## Hide certain prefixed variables in the Debug panel
Our telnet adapter currently creates variables like `vscodeLoopKey`, `vscodeLoopItem`, etc. This variable shows up in the `Local variables` panel after the first step. We have established the prefix `__rokudebug__` for tool-generated variables and we will use it to avoid showing them in the Debug panel.

## Fix off-by-1 bug with threads over protocol
We fixed a bug in the Debug Protocol where the wrong line numbers were being reported for the threads response. We had incorrectly assumed that the protocol reported 0-based line numbers, when in fact they are 1-based.

## Increased the timeout for debug protocol control
For larger apps it takes longer than 5 seconds to finish parsing and compiling the app. We need to increase our Debug Protocol timeout as well. Ideally this would be configurable, but in the short term we have just doubled the timeout length.

## SceneGraph Inspector improvements
The SceneGraph Inspector has been enhanced with a new keypath syntax which should make it much easier to identify a specific node in the scene at a point in time. This is powered by some [better keypath logic](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/455) in RDB. You can see the new `keyPath` field in the screenshot below:

We've also improved the reliability of the focus scrolling.

## New diagnostic for max callfunc arguments
An undocumented limitation of SceneGraph's `callfunc` functionality is that you cannot pass more than 5 arguments. Doing so would cause the call to silently fail, and sometimes even crash the application. ([BrighterScript#765](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/765)) adds a diagnostic to flag these types of calls so you can detect them at compile time instead of at runtime.

## Syntax highlighting for `continue for` and `continue while`
Syntax highlighting for the new `continue while` and `continue for` keywords was fixed in [v2.38.7](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2387---2023-01-24)

## Fix process to test related projects

We want to make sure changes to BrighterScript don't break the main projects that depend on it. For a while now, our script to test the related `RokuCommunity` projects had problems with certain repositories that found ancestors inside `node_modules`. To fix that, now we use the system `tempdir` instead of a local `.tmp` folder.

We have also added the test suites for the projects [rooibos](https://github.com/georgejecook/rooibos) and [maestro-roku-bsc-plugin](https://github.com/georgejecook/maestro-roku-bsc-plugin).

## Improved extension development experience
Historically, you'd need to manually launch watcher tasks for each RokuCommunity project that you were actively working on. As of ([#456](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-la  nguage/pull/456)), we automatically find all RokuCommunity repositories cloned at the same level as vscode-brightscript-language, and kick of a combined watcher task for all of them. This greatly simplifies the development experience, reducing confusion for community contributors.

## Fix Github action that creates .vsix files on PR changes

If you are a contributor to the [roku-debug](https://github.com/rokucommunity/roku-debug) repository, you might have notice that we have a commenter bot that creates `.vsix` files for you on each PR update.

The link to the instalation instructions was broken. Now we have updated it to open the correct page in our new website: [rokucommunity.github.io](https://rokucommunity.github.io/).
