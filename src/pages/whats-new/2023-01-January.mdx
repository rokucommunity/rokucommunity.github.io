## Allow relative RALE tracker task path
The RALE tracker task path can now be a relative path, and supports replacement variables like `${workspaceFolder}`

## SceneGraph Inspector improvements
The SceneGraph Inspector has been enhanced with a new keypath syntax which should make it much easier to identify a specific node in the scene at a point in time. This is powered by some [better keypath logic](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/455) in RDB. You can see the new `keyPath` field in the screenshot below:

We've also improved the reliability of the focus scrolling.

## New diagnostic for max callfunc arguments
An undocumented limitation of SceneGraph's `callfunc` functionality is that you cannot pass more than 5 arguments. Doing so would cause the call to silently fail, and sometimes even crash the application. ([BrighterScript#765](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/765)) adds a diagnostic to flag these types of calls so you can detect them at compile time instead of at runtime.


----TODO add screenshot of diagnostic----

## Syntax highlighting for `continue for` and `continue while`
Syntax highlighting for the new `continue while` and `continue for` keywords was fixed in [v2.38.7](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2387---2023-01-24)

# Preview features

# Misc
## Improved extension development experience
Historically, you'd need to manually launch watcher tasks for each RokuCommunity project that you were actively working on. As of ([#456](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/456)), we automatically find all RokuCommunity repositories cloned at the same level as vscode-brightscript-language, and kick of a combined watcher task for all of them. This greatly simplifies the development experience, reducing confusion for community contributors.
