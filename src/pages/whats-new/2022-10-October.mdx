## Brand new website!
We are pleased to present our brand new website, [rokucommunity.github.io](https://rokucommunity.github.io). This is a great resource for showcasing all of the different projects and tools that are managed by RokuCommunity.

A huge shout out to [Arturo Cuya](https://github.com/arturocuya) for the fantastic work designing and building the site.

## VSCode Extension Updates
We've added several new features to the BrightScript language extension for VSCode.


### All launch configuration settings are now available in user/workspace settings under the `brightscript.debug` key ([#438](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/438))

### The "clear rendezvous history" button has been moved out of the menu and into the title bar of that section ([#444](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/444))

### Rendezvous events can now be cleared even when debug session is not running. ([#444](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/444))

### Added a `brightscript.deviceDiscovery.concealDeviceInfo` option to obscure the device-info ([#443](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/443))
This can be very useful when recording a presentation, as it will conceal all of your Roku's sensitive information. All of the device IDs in the screenshot below have been obscured.

### Fixed crash when device encountered certain rendezvous log entries ([roku-debug#108](https://github.com/rokucommunity/roku-debug/pull/108))

### Added goto definition for enum statements and enum members ([brighterscript#715](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/pull/715))
