<!-- 2024-05-29 (for v2.48.4 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/574 -->




## Prompt to restart lsp if it has stopped
<!-- 2024-05-31 (for v2.48.4 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/575 -->

Whenever the language server crashes, vscode will restart it. After the 5th crash, they'll leave it permanently crashed. There seems to be no time limit on adding up to the 5, so even after a few days, vscode may still terminate the language server. 

This PR adds tracking for when language server is stopped and then not started back up again after a period of time.
For example, 20 seconds after after the final failure, this event fires so that we can show a "wanna restart it" popup.

## Fix lsp crash tracker
<!-- 2024-06-04 (for v2.48.5 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/576 -->

# Debugging

## Prevent corrupted breakpoints due to invalid sourceDirs, add more logging
<!-- 2024-05-22 (for v0.21.9 released on 2024-06-03), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/189 -->

Prevent breakpoints from becoming corrupted due to bad sourceDirs entries.
Also adds many `.debug` logs during the breakpoint flows.



# BrighterScript

## Fixes some issues with comments and transpilation
<!-- 2024-05-16 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1192 -->

Fixes:

- leading comments before `alias`, `typecast`, and `import` statements

- comments on same line as previous statement before `namespace`



## Component field can be set with strings
<!-- 2024-05-21 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1195 -->

Addresses #1191 

Changes `assignementTypeMismatch` validation so that if LHS is a DottedSetStatement, and the `obj` is a ComponentType (ie. a SG Node), and RHS is a string, then do not show the validation diagnostic.



## Adds AugmentedAssignmentStatement
<!-- 2024-05-22 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1196 -->

code like this:

```
sub foo(t)
   t += 1
end sub
```

used to be an assignment statement, with a binary Expression... eg:

```
Assignment (t, '=') -> 
     BinaryExpression (t, '+=', 1)
```

which included "t" twice

This is changed to a single `AugmentedAssignmentStatement`

```
AugmentedAssignment (t, '+=', 1)
```


Additionally, this PR makes sure the parser only builds Assignments (including typed Assignments) when it is allowed to.

I also added tests for `AugmentedAssignmentStatement` and `IncrementStatement`


Addresses #1186 




## Fix semantic token crash
<!-- 2024-05-22 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1197 -->

Exclude semantic tokens that have no range (we wouldn't know where to colorize anyway...)

## Temporarily disable test-related-projects until they support v1
<!-- 2024-05-24 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1202 -->

Disable the `test-related-projects` job until those projects support v1. These jobs currently take a long time because they're all failing with thousands of errors due to v1 incompatibility.


## Fix crash with optional chaining in signature help
<!-- 2024-05-28 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1207 -->

![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/2544493/fdfc25d6-edcb-4f56-b04e-7383de180c75)



## Validate single scope
<!-- 2024-05-31 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1123 -->

With version 1, we will be changing how validation works. The goal is that all files will still be totally validated, except the method will be different.
Currently, in v0.65, when a file changes, all files in all affected scopes are validated. This validation is rather basic - checking number of function arguments, verifying no duplicate function names, etc.

In version 1, the validation is much more rigorous, as all known types, namespaces, variables, etc. are fully checked for how they are used (as function args, return values, property access, etc.). This is taking MUCH longer to do, especially for files that are included in many scopes, like a utils file with common functions that’s included in every component.
So we are going to experiment with only checking the first scope a file is in, then also producing validation errors if we expect there might be errors in other scopes.

For example, let’s say `FileA` references function `someFunc` that is not defined in the same file, and `FileA` is included in 2 different components.

If `FileA` changes, it will only be fully validated in the scope of the first component. In that context, if `someFunc` is defined (and its usage is consistent with its definition) there will be no error. However, we also check that someFunc is available (and compatible) in the context of the second scope.

If `someFunc` is not defined in the second component, or it has a different function signature, we will add a diagnostic error to say that the symbol is inconsistent across scopes.

Because we only need to fully check the files in the first scope, things go much quicker. The only downside is that the errors will be a little non-specific, eg. “Function `someFunc` is not compatible in `Component A` and `Component B`”, vs. if we fully validated, we know stuff like the properties of the return type of the function are different, and these are the differences, and it’s ok, or maybe a problem in the the context of the usage, etc.


## Document the deprecated `ifMessagePort.setPort()` method.
<!-- 2024-06-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1210 -->

Adds info about the deprecated `ifMessagePort.setPort()` method.

![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/2544493/92349711-2fd4-4443-bacc-92da2d934455)


TODO - it would be nice to show strikethrough on the deprecated method somehow in the editor. 

Also, based on [this discussion](https://rokudevelopers.slack.com/archives/CF419UU80/p1715179435039329), should this actually be added to the roUrlTransfer object instead of ifUrlTransfer? Those don't currently support having their own methods in our scraper, but it could?




## Visualize deprecated items in editor
<!-- 2024-06-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1213 -->

Shows deprecated items in the editor as deprecated (strikethrough in vscode). This works by sending a `Hint` diagnostic with `DiagnosticTag.Deprecated` in the diagnostic tags.

## Removes 'duplicate enum' diagnostic and makes 'duplicate function' mu…
<!-- 2024-06-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1212 -->

- Duplicate Enum Definition diagnostic was Already covered by the `name collision` diagnostic, so it was removed
- Duplicate Function Implementation diagnostic was made 'multi-scope' using the scope information in the related Information. 


Fixes: #1208 

![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/dfb9ec23-a377-4fa1-9a01-4ee7dec5e6ac)



## Refines ScopeValidator Diagnostics to use more specific Diagnostic tags
<!-- 2024-06-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1211 -->

Fixes an issue where more diagnostics would be cleared on file changes than should have been.

Fixes #1209


## Fixes Transpile issue with enums in namespaces
<!-- 2024-06-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.31 released on 2024-06-04), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1216 -->

Fixes #1215 



## Elevate `thenby` to a prod dependency
<!-- 2024-06-05 (for v1.0.0-alpha.32 released on 2024-06-05), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1217 -->

We started using `thenby` as a prod dependency, but it was marked as a devDependency which causes crashes at runtime.

## Adds messagePort methods to `ifSocketAsync` and `MultiStyleLabel.drawingStyles`
<!-- 2024-06-06 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1220 -->

Fixes issues:
#1218 
#1198



## Flag using devDependency in production code
<!-- 2024-06-06 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1222 -->

Prevent using devDependencies in prod code.


## Fixes issue with setting `roSGNodeTargetSet.targetRects`
<!-- 2024-06-07 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1223 -->

Fixes #1219

Reason this was a problem is because the scraper did not understand `array of rectangles` as a type.


I wish Roku would use actual types here! The interface type should have been `rect2dArray` ... oh well..


I also updated the diagnostic message for type incompatibility to be able to add a override for the extended message which is useful if assigning Arrays of different default types, and the inner type is incompatible.

Example:
```brighterscript
targetSet = createObject("roSGNode", "TargetSet")
targets = ["hello", "world"]
targetSet.targetRects = targets ' targetRects is an array of rectangles, which are AA's with x,y,width,height
```



Before


```
"Type 'Array<string>' is not compatible with type 'Array<roAssociativeArray>'
    Type 'Array<string>' is missing the following members: height, width, x, y, ifAssociativeArray, AddReplace, Append, Clear, Count, Delete, DoesExist, Items, Keys, Lookup, LookupCI, ...and 5 more"
```


Now:

```
"Type 'Array<string>' is not compatible with type 'Array<roAssociativeArray>'
    Type 'string' is missing the following members of type 'roAssociativeArray': height, width, x, y, ifAssociativeArray, AddReplace, Append, Clear, Count, Delete, DoesExist, Items, Keys, Lookup, LookupCI, ...and 5 more"
```

## Remove block starting range
<!-- 2024-06-10 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1224 -->

Removes the `startingRange` property on Blocks.

If a block is not empty, the range of a Block is the range of its statements

If the block is empty, the Block looks at its parent to see what the range should be, with specific logic for all the different types of nodes that can contain a block.


## Removed expectRangeToBe helper
<!-- 2024-06-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1226 -->




## Removed `isInline` property from `IfStatement` 
<!-- 2024-06-12 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1227 -->

- It was changed to a getter, so that proper diagnostic could still be added if there was a problem.
- Added tests for inline conditional statements
- Added support for nested inline conditionals. (People must have a deathwish!)


## fix: conform bsconfig.schema.json to strict types
<!-- 2024-06-13 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1205 -->

## Summary

bsconfig.schema.json is not (strict) type valid against jsonschema draft-07 target

fixes https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/issues/1204

## Details

- remove the `"deprecationMessage"` attribute from "ignoreErrorCodes"
- add `"type": "array"` to the "files".

## Validation steps

1. Install `npm install -g ajv-cli`
2. compile schema with `ajv compile -s bsconfig.schema.json --allow-union-types=true`
```
schema bsconfig.schema.json is valid
```


## Allow updating leading trivia
<!-- 2024-06-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1225 -->

- All AstNodes will return an editable array of tokens when calling `.getLeadingTrivia()`
- No longer concatenates leading trivia of annotations above a statement
- Refined utils functions that get node documentation to ensure all comments are included, and these concatenate leading trivia of associated annotations 


Addresses #1206


## Made `AstNode.getLeadingTrivia()` a getter
<!-- 2024-06-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1233 -->

- Changed `AstNode.getLeadingTrivia()` to `AstNode.leadingTrivia`
- Changed `getEndTrivia()` as well
- Added Tests to verify comments (and changed comments) appear in transpiled output


## Fix crash with missing scope
<!-- 2024-06-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1234 -->

Fix crash during transpile when a file was not associated with any scopes


## Convert .range to .location
<!-- 2024-06-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.33 released on 2024-06-14), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1231 -->

Convert all `.range` properties to `.location`. This allows all tokens to know what file they came from. This is a fairly significant breaking change. 

TODO

- [x] convert all `.range` to `.location`
- [x] add unit tests ensuring sourcemaps properly track tokens from multiple files
- [x] ensure transpiled output is the same for a few large projects

## bslint
## Sorts diagnostics in tests for errors on same line
<!-- 2024-06-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.32 released on 2024-06-05), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/111 -->

This fixes the tests when tested using Brighterscript v1 once the Brighterscript validator does single scope validation
