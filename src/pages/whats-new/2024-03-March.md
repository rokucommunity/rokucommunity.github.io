## New Roku File System Panel
<!-- 2024-02-29 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/545 -->
This month we added a new panel called "Roku File System". This panel will be avaiable anytime the app is running with RDB enabled, and will show all the files in your app as they exist on-device.

## New Roku App Overlays Panel
<!-- 2024-02-29 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/545 -->
Another new panel we've added is called "Roku App Overlays". This panel enables you to register images that will be overlayed onto your running application. This is incredibly useful when trying to build out UI elements against an existing mockup image. This panel will be active anytime the app is running with RTA enabled. Here's a quick demo showing how it works. You can show and hide the image, change its transparency, rename the image, add multiple images, etc.

## Improvements to document symbols
<!-- 2024-03-19 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1116 -->
We've improved the document symbols included within vscode. Several symbol types were missing, such as constants, enums, and certain classes.

We also removed the leading namespace values from relevat symbols since they're shown in grey next to the symbols anyway. This improves searchability for these symbols as vscode would get confused when typing the symbols without leading namespaces in some situations.

## Fix random disconnects in vscode panels
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/548 -->

 We've been having issues with some of the panels from the BrightScript Language vscode extension randomly disconnecting from the Roku device during debug sessions. We've fixed several bugs causing this issue.  There's not much to show here, but hopefully you will see more stability when using these features in the future.


## Better stability during sideload
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/548 -->
The Roku Device View panel in vscode works by capturing screenshots as fast as the device can generate them. We noticed this was causing issues when sideloading new app builds to the device, as we must be putting too much stress on the device during that time which causes the device to time out. To mitigate this, we now pause the device view screenshot capturing during the sideloading process. This has significantly reduced the failure rate during the sideloading process. Once the device successfully sideloads the app, we resume the screenshot behavior, so you shouldn't notice any difference in experience.

## Add some enhanced launch settings to support more diverse projects
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/538 -->
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v0.21.5 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/184 -->
As of vscode v2.46.0, you can now further customize your launch process. Many developers have custom build processes such as makefile or shell scripts. Historically, the vscode extension hasn't supported this process because the extension needs to be in control over the entire process. However, we felt it was important for dev teams to be able to use as much of their existing build process as possible.

We've added the ability to register a custom `packageTask` that will bulid the `.zip` instead of having vscode build it. VSCode still needs to be the one moving files into the staging directory, but if you have a custom zipping process, this will now allow you to leverage that feature. Here's an example launch.json with these new features:

```javascript
{
    //this is a vscode "task" which should be registered in ./vscode/tasks.json
    "packageTask": "name-of-task-that-zips-your-app",
     //where should vscode put the files that are ready to be staged?
    "stagingDir": "./dist",
     //where did you put your zip?
    "packagePath": "./out/custom.zip"
}
```

We've also added a few missing launch.json settings such as `stagingDir` (not sure how that one went undocumented for so long....).

## Fix crash when trying to copy numeric values to the clipboard
<!-- 2024-03-05 (for v2.46.1 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/550 -->

If you've ever used the "Roku Devices" panel, you may have noticed that you couldn't copy numeric values to the clipboard. That has now been fixed as of vscode extension v2.46.1!

**Before:**

## Fix conditional compile syntax highlighting
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v2.46.1 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/551 -->

We've fixed some issues with syntax highlighting for conditional compile items with spaces between `#` and the next keyword (we didn't even know BrightScript supported spaces there!).

# Debugging

## Optional Chainging Operator errors in debug console
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v0.21.7 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/187 -->
We fixed a bug when evaluating optional chaining expressions in the vscode REPL or watch panel that would crash instead of properly evaluating the expression. Here are some examples of expressions that should now properly evaluate:

```brightscript
print m.top.gridState?.leftEdgeTime
print m.top.gridState?["leftEdgeTime"]
print m.top.gridState?.["leftEdgeTime"]
```


# BrighterScript

## Add plugin hook for documentSymbol and workspaceSybmol
<!-- 2024-03-19 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1116 -->
<!-- 2024-03-21 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1118 -->
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1120 -->
Starting in BrighterScript v0.65.27, plugin authors can contribute their own document and workspace symbols by using thes enew plugin hooks:
 - `beforeProvideDocumentSymbols`
 - `provideDocumentSymbols`
 - `afterProvideDocumentSymbols`

 - `beforeProvideWorkspaceSymbols`
 - `provideWorkspaceSymbols`
 - `afterProvideWorkspaceSymbols`

We've moved the brighterscript logic into the internal brighterscript plugin, so plugin authors can review [DocumentSymbolProcessor](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/blob/master/src/bscPlugin/symbols/DocumentSymbolProcessor.ts) and [WorkspaceSymbolProcessor](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/blob/master/src/bscPlugin/symbols/WorkspaceSymbolProcessor.ts) for examples of how to contribute these symbols. It's also worth looking at how we've implemented our AST walking to discover symbols, which can be found in [this PR](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1120).


# Community Tools

### Fix safe colors
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v0.8.20 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/101 -->
We've updated the broadcast safe color for white to now be `#EBEBEB` instead of `#DBDBDB`. In the future, we'd love to make this list configurable, so if you have any interest in contributing to this, [let us know](https://github.com/rokucommunity/bslint/issues/new).


## brs
The [brs](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs) project is a BrightScript interpreter that runs off-device, and is implemented in javascript.

###  Fixed #43 - Implemented `roString` methods `startsWith()` and `endsWith()`
<!-- 2024-02-07 (for v0.45.5 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs/pull/44 -->
We've added runtime support for the  `startsWith()` and `endsWith()` methods on the `roString` object. Here's the new methods in action in the brs repl:

### Fixed #8 -Arithmetic Operator Modulo behavior to match Roku
<!-- 2024-03-25 (for v0.45.5 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs/pull/46 -->

We discovered that the MOD operator in BrightScript always truncates the result value, even for float and double values. We've aligned the brs runtime to match this behavior.

### Fixed path handling for Windows #27
<!-- 2024-03-25 (for v0.45.5 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs/pull/45 -->

We fixed several Windows-specific crashes where brs was not correctly handling Windows path separators. We've fixed these bugs which should now allow brs to run more consistently in Windows environments.


### Implemented component `roList`
<!-- 2024-03-26 (for v0.45.5 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs/pull/48 -->
We've added support for `roList`, and both `File` and `String` now use it.

# Community Libraries

# brighterscript-formatter

### Add `insertSpaceAfterConditionalCompileSymbol`, fix conditional compile formatting
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v1.7.0 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript-formatter/pull/87 -->

RokuCommunity's brightscript and brighterscript formatter has gotten a a new formatting option called `insertSpaceAfterConditionalCompileSymbol`. This option manages spacing between the `#` and the following keyword. When `true`, the formatter will add a single space character, and when `false` it will remove all whitespace between them.


![format-cond-compile](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript-formatter/assets/2544493/d01e3451-bccd-4784-8f43-6f54ce5634db)

We've also fixed indentation issues with conditional compile tokens that have spaces after the `#` (like `# if`, `# else if`, etc...).

<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.27 released on 2024-03-08), ([978108a](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/commit/978108a)) -->

## BrighterScript


## Reduce null safety issues in Statement and Expression subclasses
<!-- 2024-03-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1033 -->

This fixes most of the null safety issues in Statements and Expressions. I left a few that seemed like they'd be disruptive to modify.

The largest changes were widening the type of `TranspileResult` to be a tree rather than a flat array, and wrapping constructions of `SourceNode` in a helper which does a type coercion.

Most of the changes were setting the `Range` field to be optional everywhere and adding manual type annotations to the `result` variable in `transpile` methods, to avoid issues with `never[]` being inferred as a type.

Please let me know if any of these changes cause excessive merge conflicts and I can back them out.


## Allow negative patterns in diagnostic filters
<!-- 2024-03-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1078 -->

This feature lets users prefix a glob with `!` to make it a negative pattern which un-ignores certain errors. My use case for this is one which I've added to the documentation; I want to ignore errors from all dependencies in a project _except_ for one specific dependency, and I don't want to have to maintain a list of all other dependencies any time one is added or moved.

Using file paths to indicate un-ignores means that it's not possible to un-ignore a code without specifying a file path. A workaround for this is to use the glob `!*/**/*`, matching everything in the rootDir. I've added this to the documentation and the tests.

The implementation is such that it's possible to un-un-un-un-ignore patterns to any depth. This is likely overkill and would be inadvisable to do in practice, but I think the semantics of this are actually simpler and more familiar than it would be to have things bottom out at a specific level.


## Add `create-test-package` command for easier tgz testing
<!-- 2024-03-06 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1088 -->

Adds a new package.json command called `create-test-package` that generates a .tgz npm package that can be used for testing the current brighterscript code. It also copies the install command to the clipboard so it's easier to run in the project you want to test.

![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/2544493/52f38c29-4e80-44f0-abd8-1edc69d8991d)

It copies this to clipboard:
```bash
npm i file:c:/projects/roku/brighterscript1/.tmp/brighterscript-0.65.24-test.1709734928445.tgz
```



## Support whitespace in conditional compile keywords
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1090 -->

Fixes parse errors when conditional compile keywords have spaces between the # and the keyword. They support any number of spaces or tabs or a combination of the two.

## Support when tokens have null ranges
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1072 -->

Many plugins use `Parser.parse()` to generate AST used to replace existing code. This causes the generated sourcemaps to be very incorrect. To mitigate this, we should support generating AST without any range information at all. But, lots of our codebase explodes when that happens.

This PR adds a test that verifies _most_ expressions and statements  can transpile to proper code without needing tokens. There may be some edge cases, but we've tried to hit as many as possible.

Here's how you can leverage this new functionality:

```typescript
const tokens = Parser.parse('print hello', { trackLocations: false });
```

The tokens array will have all the same tokens, but none of them will have location information, making them much safer to inject into AST without messing with sourcemaps.


## Removes `CommentStatement` and all comment tokens from Lexer output
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1083 -->

- Comments now reside SOLELY in leading trivia.
- `TranspileState.transpileToken()` will automatically transpile comments (if they exist) ahead of the token
- To still indent comments before a "block closing token" (eg. `}`, `end sub`, etc), use TranspileState.transpileEndBlockToken()`
- Modified getSignatureHelp, getDocumentation, etc. to use leading trivia only



## Adds type to const hovers and adds hover for for-each loop vars
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1092 -->

Fixes #1087

## Formal support and tests for various Variable and name shadowing rules
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1089 -->

- Added a docs page to explain
- Modified some logic and added tests to specify exactly what is allowed and and what causes an error
- refactored code to reduce use of `FunctionScope`
- realized there was a typo in a file name (`SymbolTableFlag.ts` -> `SymbolTypeFlag.ts`)

Addresses #1041


## Export symbol type flag
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1094 -->

Add back in the missing `SymbolTypeFlag` interface so plugins can use it.


## Types 'm' as AssocArray in function in AALiteral
<!-- 2024-03-10 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1097 -->

- Types 'm' as AssocArray in function in AALiteral


Fixes #1084


## Fix classname as variable for completions and validations
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1096 -->


https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/96313697-7232-4e9e-bdc3-60876fc83783

When a Class constructor function is used outside of `new` it is treated as a function type, allowing code completion and validation based on that.

This PR also adds member (and method) validation on primitive types in general


## Removes diagnostic when using variable declared with unknown type
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1098 -->

- Addresses #1095
- Any variable declared via assignment or as function param will not cause the "Cannot find ..."  Diagnostic
- Adds validation for invalid type in the `typeExpression` in an assignment statement


![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/2162c996-ad18-477a-ade5-04877212711e)



## Improves message for empty throw statements
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1099 -->

- transpiles empty throw with "User-specified exception"
- addresses #1086


## Move scope.validate() into BscPlugin
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1105 -->

Move the `scope.validate()` call into the BscPlugin


## Fixes issue with AA overriding built-in properties
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1106 -->

Fixes #1102

AssociativeArray types now follow the same pattern as Class Types, where the built in members are from a different symbol provider, so if they are overriden, the overriden type info is used.



## Fixes bitwise operator typing
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1107 -->

Fixes #1103

## Prevent unused variable warnings on ternary and null coalescence expressions
<!-- 2024-03-13 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1101 -->

Prevents unused variable warnings when transpiling ternary and null coalescence expressions if they include enums and constants.

Addresses: #1091


## Fix transpile crash when token has no text
<!-- 2024-03-13 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1109 -->

Fix crash in during transpile when token is defined but doesn't have `text` (no idea how this happens, but better to prevent crashing)


## Increase max param count to 63
<!-- 2024-03-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1112 -->

Increases the max number of function parameters from 32 to 63, which seems to have been implemented in the Roku OS since OS 11.5 and above

## Added ArrayDefaultTypeReferenceType for when array symbol is not defined yet
<!-- 2024-03-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1111 -->

Needed to add a whole new ReferenceType for this use case!

Because the for-each-loop target was defined on a namespace, it wasn't defined yet at File-validation time (Namespaces are only defined at scope linking), so the default type was unknown.

Now that we have a reference type for this particular case, the array symbol can be defined in the future, and the for-each item will be automatically known.

## More validation performance
<!-- 2024-03-20 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1110 -->

Refactors local variable checking to only check un-changed `AstSegment`s for function shadowing if those segments make an assignment to a symbol that changed.

Before:
```
validate@local   ---------- 51.368 ops/sec
validate@0.65.26 --------- 101.435 ops/sec
```

After:
```
validate@local   --------- 286.331 ops/sec
validate@0.65.26 --------- 102.877 ops/sec
```


## Significant Validation Improvement
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1119 -->

- Adds metrics for validation (link time and validation time)
- Refactored namespace linking to make better use of file-level caching
- Adds significant changes to how validation is performed:
  - Whole scopes are culled from validation if there are not changes that effect that immediate scope
  - Better file culling for name shadowing checks based on changed symbols


Overall, this should cut initial validation time down to about 40%, and *should* make validation changes in editor *much* faster...

## Fix bug in range and position caching
<!-- 2024-03-28 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1126 -->

Fixes an issue in `util.createRange()` and `util.createPosition()` where integers over 13 bits long would sometimes generate an incorrect cache key (thus returning the wrong cached value and wrong position/range values).
