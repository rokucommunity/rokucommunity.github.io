## New Roku File System Panel
<!-- 2024-02-29 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/545 -->
This month we added a new panel called "Roku File System". This panel will be avaiable anytime the app is running with RDB enabled, and will show all the files in your app as they exist on-device.

## New Roku App Overlays Panel
<!-- 2024-02-29 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/545 -->
Another new panel we've added is called "Roku App Overlays". This panel enables you to register images that will be overlayed onto your running application. This is incredibly useful when trying to build out UI elements against an existing mockup image. This panel will be active anytime the app is running with RTA enabled. Here's a quick demo showing how it works. You can show and hide the image, change its transparency, rename the image, add multiple images, etc.

## Improvements to document symbols
<!-- 2024-03-19 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1116 -->
We've improved the document symbols included within vscode. Several symbol types were missing, such as constants, enums, and certain classes.

We also removed the leading namespace values from relevat symbols since they're shown in grey next to the symbols anyway. This improves searchability for these symbols as vscode would get confused when typing the symbols without leading namespaces in some situations.

## Fix random disconnects in vscode panels
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/548 -->

 We've been having issues with some of the panels from the BrightScript Language vscode extension randomly disconnecting from the Roku device during debug sessions. We've fixed several bugs causing this issue.  There's not much to show here, but hopefully you will see more stability when using these features in the future.


## Better stability during sideload
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/548 -->
The Roku Device View panel in vscode works by capturing screenshots as fast as the device can generate them. We noticed this was causing issues when sideloading new app builds to the device, as we must be putting too much stress on the device during that time which causes the device to time out. To mitigate this, we now pause the device view screenshot capturing during the sideloading process. This has significantly reduced the failure rate during the sideloading process. Once the device successfully sideloads the app, we resume the screenshot behavior, so you shouldn't notice any difference in experience.

## Add some enhanced launch settings to support more diverse projects
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v2.46.0 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/538 -->
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v0.21.5 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/184 -->
As of vscode v2.46.0, you can now further customize your launch process. Many developers have custom build processes such as makefile or shell scripts. Historically, the vscode extension hasn't supported this process because the extension needs to be in control over the entire process. However, we felt it was important for dev teams to be able to use as much of their existing build process as possible.

We've added the ability to register a custom `packageTask` that will bulid the `.zip` instead of having vscode build it. VSCode still needs to be the one moving files into the staging directory, but if you have a custom zipping process, this will now allow you to leverage that feature. Here's an example launch.json with these new features:

```javascript
{
    //this is a vscode "task" which should be registered in ./vscode/tasks.json
    "packageTask": "name-of-task-that-zips-your-app",
     //where should vscode put the files that are ready to be staged?
    "stagingDir": "./dist",
     //where did you put your zip?
    "packagePath": "./out/custom.zip"
}
```

We've also added a few missing launch.json settings such as `stagingDir` (not sure how that one went undocumented for so long....).

## Fix crash when trying to copy numeric values to the clipboard
<!-- 2024-03-05 (for v2.46.1 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/550 -->

If you've ever used the "Roku Devices" panel, you may have noticed that you couldn't copy numeric values to the clipboard. That has now been fixed as of vscode extension v2.46.1!

**Before:**

## Fix conditional compile syntax highlighting
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v2.46.1 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/551 -->

We've fixed some issues with syntax highlighting for conditional compile items with spaces between `#` and the next keyword (we didn't even know BrightScript supported spaces there!).

# Debugging

## Optional Chainging Operator errors in debug console
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v0.21.7 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/187 -->
We fixed a bug when evaluating optional chaining expressions in the vscode REPL or watch panel that would crash instead of properly evaluating the expression. Here are some examples of expressions that should now properly evaluate:

```brightscript
print m.top.gridState?.leftEdgeTime
print m.top.gridState?["leftEdgeTime"]
print m.top.gridState?.["leftEdgeTime"]
```


# BrighterScript

### Allow negative patterns in diagnostic filters
<!-- 2024-03-04 (for v0.65.25 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1078 -->
If you haven't been using `diagnosticFilters` in brighterscript yet, you should definitely take a look at [the docs](https://github.com/rokucommunity/BrighterScript/blob/master/docs/bsconfig.md#diagnosticFilters). These filters support ignoring a list of diagnostics for a specific file or groups of files. Developers commonly use these to ignore errors in vendor libraries that they don't have direct control over modifying (or don't want to modify).

This month we added support for negated patterns in the src patters, which is makes the feature even more powerful. You can now do things like this:

```json
"diagnosticFilters": [
    { "src": "vendor/**/*" }, //ignore all errors from vendor libraries
    { "src": "!*/**/*", "codes": [1000] } //except DO show this particular code everywhere
]
```

What's great about this is you can even stack multiple patterns together to curate a very specific list of diagnostics, by combining negative and positive patterns, codes, etc.


### Prevent unused variable warnings on ternary and null coalescence expressions
<!-- 2024-03-13 (for v0.65.26 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1101 -->
We've had a longstanding bug that when using enums in a ternary expression, the transpiled could would incorrectly inject those enum values into the `bslib_ternary()` call. This wouldn't cause runtime errors since they were never referenced, but it did produce `unused variable` errors on-device.

Here's an example of the issue. This ternary operation:
```brightscript
buttonBaseWidth = (nodeId = "closedCaptions") ? ClosedCaptionsButtonSize.Width : ThumbButtonSize.Width
```

Would transpile to:
```brightscript
buttonBaseWidth = (function(__bsCondition, ClosedCaptionsButtonSize, ThumbButtonSize)
    if __bsCondition then
        return 38
    else
        return 40
    end if
end function)((nodeId = "closedCaptions"), ClosedCaptionsButtonSize, ThumbButtonSize)
```

Notice the `ClosedCaptionsButtonSize` being passed as a variable? That causes an `unused variable` device warning in the console when the app is sideloaded.

BrighterScript `v0.65.26` includes a fix for this issue, and now the _names_ of these enums are omitted from the transpiled output (which is fine since the enums were injected into the inner function body already anyway.

```brightscript
buttonBaseWidth = (function(__bsCondition)
    if __bsCondition then
        return 38
    else
        return 40
    end if
end function)((nodeId = "closedCaptions"))
```

You can check out the [pull request](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1101) for how we solved this, or the [original issue](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/issues/1091) if you're curious what the


### Add plugin hook for documentSymbol and workspaceSybmol
<!-- 2024-03-19 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1116 -->
<!-- 2024-03-21 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1118 -->
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1120 -->
Starting in BrighterScript v0.65.27, plugin authors can contribute their own document and workspace symbols by using thes enew plugin hooks:
 - `beforeProvideDocumentSymbols`
 - `provideDocumentSymbols`
 - `afterProvideDocumentSymbols`

 - `beforeProvideWorkspaceSymbols`
 - `provideWorkspaceSymbols`
 - `afterProvideWorkspaceSymbols`

We've moved the brighterscript logic into the internal brighterscript plugin, so plugin authors can review [DocumentSymbolProcessor](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/blob/master/src/bscPlugin/symbols/DocumentSymbolProcessor.ts) and [WorkspaceSymbolProcessor](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/blob/master/src/bscPlugin/symbols/WorkspaceSymbolProcessor.ts) for examples of how to contribute these symbols. It's also worth looking at how we've implemented our AST walking to discover symbols, which can be found in [this PR](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1120).


### Support when tokens have null ranges
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v0.65.25 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1072 -->

Many brighterscript plugins use `Parser.parse()` to generate AST used to replace existing code. This causes the generated sourcemaps to be very incorrect. To mitigate this, we added support for generating AST without any range information at all.

Now _most_ expressions and statements can transpile to proper code without needing location information. There was a _lot_ of internal brighterscript typescript code that didn't like when AST nodes had null ranges and there may be some edge cases, but we believe we've fixed most of those issues.

Here's how you can leverage this new functionality:

```typescript
const tokens = Parser.parse('print hello', { trackLocations: false });
```

The tokens array will have all the same tokens, but none of them will have location information, making them much safer to inject into AST without messing with sourcemaps.

### Fix safe colors
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v0.8.20 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/101 -->
We've updated the broadcast safe color for white to now be `#EBEBEB` instead of `#DBDBDB`. In the future, we'd love to make this list configurable, so if you have any interest in contributing to this, [let us know](https://github.com/rokucommunity/bslint/issues/new).


## brs
The [brs](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs) project is a BrightScript interpreter that runs off-device, and is implemented in javascript.

### Implemented `roString` methods `startsWith()` and `endsWith()`
<!-- 2024-02-07 (for v0.45.5 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs/pull/44 -->
We've added runtime support for the  `startsWith()` and `endsWith()` methods on the `roString` object. Here's the new methods in action in the brs repl:

### Align Arithmetic Operator Modulo behavior to match Roku
<!-- 2024-03-25 (for v0.45.5 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs/pull/46 -->

We discovered that the MOD operator in BrightScript always truncates the result value, even for float and double values. We've aligned the brs runtime to match this behavior.

### Fixed path handling for Windows
<!-- 2024-03-25 (for v0.45.5 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs/pull/45 -->

We fixed several Windows-specific crashes where brs was not correctly handling Windows path separators. We've fixed these bugs which should now allow brs to run more consistently in Windows environments.


### Implemented component `roList`
<!-- 2024-03-26 (for v0.45.5 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brs/pull/48 -->
We've added support for `roList`, and both `File` and `String` now use it.

### Add `insertSpaceAfterConditionalCompileSymbol`, fix conditional compile formatting
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v1.7.0 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript-formatter/pull/87 -->

RokuCommunity's brightscript and brighterscript formatter has gotten a a new formatting option called `insertSpaceAfterConditionalCompileSymbol`. This option manages spacing between the `#` and the following keyword. When `true`, the formatter will add a single space character, and when `false` it will remove all whitespace between them.


![format-cond-compile](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript-formatter/assets/2544493/d01e3451-bccd-4784-8f43-6f54ce5634db)

We've also fixed indentation issues with conditional compile tokens that have spaces after the `#` (like `# if`, `# else if`, etc...).


# Preview features

## bslint
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.27 released on 2024-03-08), ([978108a](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/commit/978108a)) -->
As we create new v1 alpha releases of brighterscript, we're also keeping the v1 belint alphas in sync. So for example, if you install brighterscript `v1.0.0-alpha.28`, you should also install bslint `v1.0.0-alpha.28`. There are breaking changes happening between each alpha release of brighterscript v1, which means bslint also needs to target that same bsc version.


## BrighterScript
We've got another great month full of improvements to the brighterscript v1 alpha releases. Here are some of the highlights:


### Removes `CommentStatement` and all comment tokens from Lexer output
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1083 -->
Comments in BrighterScript AST have always felt like a hack. Many parsers from other languages (such as TypeScript, eslint, the roslyn compiler, etc...) store comments as [trivia](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/compiler/ast-trivia.md) rather than actual nodes in the abstract syntax tree. As of brighterscript `v1.0.0-alpha.28`, we have now done the same. Here are the changes:

- we've removed `CommentStatement` and `CommentExpression`. Comments now reside SOLELY in a new AstNode and token property called `leadingTrivia`.
- `TranspileState.transpileToken()` will automatically transpile comments (if they exist) ahead of the token
- To still indent comments before a "block closing token" (eg. `}`, `end sub`, etc), use `TranspileState.transpileEndBlockToken()`
- Modified getSignatureHelp, getDocumentation, etc. to use leading trivia only

This is probably one of the impactful breaking changes in the BrighterScript v1 releases. We'll have more information in the coming months, but you can always look through the brighterscript source code for how leading/trailing trivia is handled.


### Adds type to const hovers and adds hover for for-each loop vars
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1092 -->

We've added const types and for-each loop vars to the hover in VSCode.

### Improved variable shadowing logic
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1089 -->

Variable shadowing in brighterscript has always been a bit challenging. Previously, you couldn't have a local variable share the same name as a global function. The same issue was present for classes, namespaces, interfaces, enums, consts, etc. This forced developers to find alternative local variable or parameter names, which could be quite frustrating.

Starting in brighterscript `v1.0.0-alpha.28`, we've improved this situation significantly. You can now declare a local variable that has the same name as a parent item, and the parent item is "shadowed"/hidden, meaning your local variable wins. You can read [the docs](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/blob/release-1.0.0/docs/variable-shadowing.md) to learn more about how all of this new logic works.

here's some example code:

```vb
function alpha()
    print "global alpha()"
end function

function test()
    alpha() ' prints "global alpha()"
end function

namespace beta

    function alpha()
        print "beta.alpha()"
    end function

    function test()
        alpha() ' prints "beta.alpha()"
    end function

    namespace charlie

        function alpha()
            print "beta.charlie.alpha()"
        end function

        function test()
            alpha() ' prints "beta.charlie.alpha()"
        end function

    end namespace

end namespace
```


### AALiteral function `m` type is now `AssociativeArray`
<!-- 2024-03-10 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1097 -->
We fixed a bug where the `m` variable inside an anonymous function inside a class method was incorrectly thinking it was the `m` from the class itself. Here's a screenshot of the error:

![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/2544493/558a1962-a071-46e8-9b7d-8039b8c97e1c)

As of brighterscript `v1.0.0-alpha.28`, that `m` will now just be a plain `AssociativeArray`

### Treat class constructor functions as function types
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1096 -->
Starting in `v1.0.0-alpha.28`, when a Class constructor function is used outside of `new` it is now treated as a function type, allowing code completion and validation based on that.

<video src="https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/96313697-7232-4e9e-bdc3-60876fc83783" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/96313697-7232-4e9e-bdc3-60876fc83783" controls="controls" muted="muted" class="d-block rounded-bottom-2 border-top width-fit" style="max-height:640px; min-height: 200px">
</video>



### Better variable handling for unknown types
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1098 -->
We've fixed a bug when a parameter has an unresolved type that causing the variable to be marked as "unknown".

Here's the issue:
![bad-interface](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/2544493/ad28326b-8534-4d6c-9a2a-1f2a39c9c5cb)


And now we show better errors, like this:
![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/2162c996-ad18-477a-ade5-04877212711e)


We've made the following fixes to mitigate the issue:
- Any variable declared via assignment or as function param will not cause the "Cannot find ..."  Diagnostic
- Adds validation for invalid type in the `typeExpression` in an assignment statement



### Improves empty throw message
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1099 -->
The BrighterScript transpiler tries its best to produce valid brightscript code, even if sometimes the original code was not valid. One such example is the `throw` statement. If you forget to include an error message, brighterscript would auto-include a generic `"An error has occurred"` message. However, that message didn't align with the default message found on device. So we've aligned with that, and that message is now `"User-specified exception"`. We recommend always writing your own messages so you can more clearly understand them throughout your code, but at least now the messages are aligned with what the device will produce.

Example. This:
```brightscript
sub main()
    try
        throw 'bs:disable-line
    catch e
    end try
end sub
```
Will now transpile to this:
```vb
sub main()
    try
        throw "User-specified exception"
    catch e
    end try
end sub
```

### Move scope.validate() into BscPlugin
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1105 -->
For contributors to BrighterScript, we've moved all of the logic from `scope.validate()` into the `BscPlugin` class, further aligning our internal plugin system with the exact same rules and restrictions that third party plugins follow. There's not much to show here, you can check out the [brighterscript#1105](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1105) to see the changes we made.


### Better AA built-in property overrides
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1106 -->
`AssociativeArray` types now follow the same pattern as `Class` types, where the built in members are from a different symbol provider, so if they are overriden, the overriden type info is used.

Here's a screenshot of the original issue:

### Fixes bitwise operator typing
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1107 -->

We fixed a bug with bitwise `and` and `or` operators showing incorrect types in the type system.

Prior to `v1.0.0-alpha.28`, here's what the type system would see:

And now we correctly show:

### Increase max param count to 63
<!-- 2024-03-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1112 -->
Historically the BrightScript runtime would only support functions having a maximum of 32 parameters. However, sometime around Roku OS 11.5, they increased this limit to 64. We've updated this limit in brighterscript as well, so you can now utilize all of those extra function parameters.

**Before:**

### Faster validation for local variables
<!-- 2024-03-20 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1110 -->

We've added significant validation performance improvements starting in `v1.0.0-alpha.29`. The first fix added some caching for local variable validations, checking only un-changed `AstSegment`s for function shadowing if those segments make an assignment to a symbol that changed.

Before:
```
validate@local   ---------- 51.368 ops/sec
validate@0.65.26 --------- 101.435 ops/sec
```

After:
```
validate@local   --------- 286.331 ops/sec
validate@0.65.26 --------- 102.877 ops/sec
```


### Scope validation performance boost
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1119 -->
We've improved overall validation times for most scope validations. Here are some of the changes we made:
- Refactored namespace linking to make better use of file-level caching
- Adds significant changes to how validation is performed:
  - Whole scopes are culled from validation if there are not changes that effect that immediate scope
  - Better file culling for name shadowing checks based on changed symbols


Overall, this should cut initial validation time down to about 40%, and *should* make validation changes in editor *much* faster...

# For Contributors
## BrighterScript null safety improvements
<!-- 2024-03-04 (for v0.65.25 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1033 -->
We've null safety issues in `Statement` and `Expression`. There isn't much else to say here other than when we eventually address all of the null safety issues in the brighterscript codebase, we'll be enabling it by default. This should help us catch a whole category of additional bugs at development time. You can review [brighterscript#1033](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1033) for more information.
