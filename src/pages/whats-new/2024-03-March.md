# Debugging

## Add some enhanced launch settings to support more diverse projects
<!-- 2024-03-01 (for v0.21.5 released on 2024-03-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/184 -->

Adds some advanced launch.json settings to support running your own zip command and a few other things.

Should release at the same time as 

https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/538


## Optional Chainging Operator errors in debug console
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v0.21.7 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/187 -->

When evaluating an expression with the optional chaining operator, where the operator is not used for the last (rightmost) path part, an error results in the debug console.

The fix is to send the expression (a dotted chain of variable names) as a whole assignment. Example: m.top.b?.c => '_var = m.top.b?.c'

Tested on OS 12.5 and added unit tests to the roku-debug workspace



# BrighterScript

## Allow Additional v1 Syntax:
<!-- 2024-02-07 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1059 -->

Allows without diagnostic, but no deeper validation:

- built-in types for class member types
- type declarations on LHS of assignments

eg. this is now ok:

```
class Foo
    node as roSGNode
end class

sub someFunc()
    myStr as string = "hello"
end sub
```


## Fix sourcemap comment and add `file` prop to map
<!-- 2024-02-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1064 -->

- Adds the `file` prop to sourcemaps to better align with the spec.
- fixes the filename in the sourceMappingUrl comment at the bottom of every file
- moves the sourceMappingUrl entry to a new line to make the file more clean


## Add support for `provideReferences` in plugins
<!-- 2024-02-09 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1066 -->

Add support for plugins to contribute `references` when running as part of a language server. 


## Fix maestro link on readme
<!-- 2024-02-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1068 -->

Current link gives a 404


## Empty interfaces break the parser
<!-- 2024-02-28 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1082 -->

Fixes a bug where empty interfaces would break the parser
Fixes #1081

## Reduce null safety issues in Statement and Expression subclasses
<!-- 2024-03-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1033 -->

This fixes most of the null safety issues in Statements and Expressions. I left a few that seemed like they'd be disruptive to modify.

The largest changes were widening the type of `TranspileResult` to be a tree rather than a flat array, and wrapping constructions of `SourceNode` in a helper which does a type coercion.

Most of the changes were setting the `Range` field to be optional everywhere and adding manual type annotations to the `result` variable in `transpile` methods, to avoid issues with `never[]` being inferred as a type.

Please let me know if any of these changes cause excessive merge conflicts and I can back them out.


## Allow negative patterns in diagnostic filters
<!-- 2024-03-04 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1078 -->

This feature lets users prefix a glob with `!` to make it a negative pattern which un-ignores certain errors. My use case for this is one which I've added to the documentation; I want to ignore errors from all dependencies in a project _except_ for one specific dependency, and I don't want to have to maintain a list of all other dependencies any time one is added or moved.

Using file paths to indicate un-ignores means that it's not possible to un-ignore a code without specifying a file path. A workaround for this is to use the glob `!*/**/*`, matching everything in the rootDir. I've added this to the documentation and the tests.

The implementation is such that it's possible to un-un-un-un-ignore patterns to any depth. This is likely overkill and would be inadvisable to do in practice, but I think the semantics of this are actually simpler and more familiar than it would be to have things bottom out at a specific level.


## Add `create-test-package` command for easier tgz testing
<!-- 2024-03-06 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1088 -->

Adds a new package.json command called `create-test-package` that generates a .tgz npm package that can be used for testing the current brighterscript code. It also copies the install command to the clipboard so it's easier to run in the project you want to test. 

![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/2544493/52f38c29-4e80-44f0-abd8-1edc69d8991d)

It copies this to clipboard:
```bash
npm i file:c:/projects/roku/brighterscript1/.tmp/brighterscript-0.65.24-test.1709734928445.tgz
```



## Support whitespace in conditional compile keywords
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1090 -->

Fixes parse errors when conditional compile keywords have spaces between the # and the keyword. They support any number of spaces or tabs or a combination of the two. 

Before:

## Support when tokens have null ranges
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1072 -->

Many plugins use `Parser.parse()` to generate AST used to replace existing code. This causes the generated sourcemaps to be very incorrect. To mitigate this, we should support generating AST without any range information at all. But, lots of our codebase explodes when that happens. 

This PR adds a test that verifies _most_ expressions and statements  can transpile to proper code without needing tokens. There may be some edge cases, but we've tried to hit as many as possible.

Here's how you can leverage this new functionality:

```typescript
const tokens = Parser.parse('print hello', { trackLocations: false });
```

The tokens array will have all the same tokens, but none of them will have location information, making them much safer to inject into AST without messing with sourcemaps.


## Removes `CommentStatement` and all comment tokens from Lexer output
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1083 -->

- Comments now reside SOLELY in leading trivia.
- `TranspileState.transpileToken()` will automatically transpile comments (if they exist) ahead of the token
- To still indent comments before a "block closing token" (eg. `}`, `end sub`, etc), use TranspileState.transpileEndBlockToken()`
- Modified getSignatureHelp, getDocumentation, etc. to use leading trivia only



## Adds type to const hovers and adds hover for for-each loop vars
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1092 -->

Fixes #1087

## Formal support and tests for various Variable and name shadowing rules
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1089 -->

- Added a docs page to explain
- Modified some logic and added tests to specify exactly what is allowed and and what causes an error
- refactored code to reduce use of `FunctionScope` 
- realized there was a typo in a file name (`SymbolTableFlag.ts` -> `SymbolTypeFlag.ts`)

Addresses #1041


## Export symbol type flag
<!-- 2024-03-08 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1094 -->

Add back in the missing `SymbolTypeFlag` interface so plugins can use it.


## Types 'm' as AssocArray in function in AALiteral
<!-- 2024-03-10 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1097 -->

- Types 'm' as AssocArray in function in AALiteral


Fixes #1084 


## Fix classname as variable for completions and validations
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1096 -->


https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/96313697-7232-4e9e-bdc3-60876fc83783

When a Class constructor function is used outside of `new` it is treated as a function type, allowing code completion and validation based on that.

This PR also adds member (and method) validation on primitive types in general


## Removes diagnostic when using variable declared with unknown type
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1098 -->

- Addresses #1095 
- Any variable declared via assignment or as function param will not cause the "Cannot find ..."  Diagnostic
- Adds validation for invalid type in the `typeExpression` in an assignment statement


![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/2162c996-ad18-477a-ade5-04877212711e)



## Improves message for empty throw statements
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1099 -->

- transpiles empty throw with "User-specified exception"
- addresses #1086


## Move scope.validate() into BscPlugin
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1105 -->

Move the `scope.validate()` call into the BscPlugin


## Fixes issue with AA overriding built-in properties
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1106 -->

Fixes #1102

AssociativeArray types now follow the same pattern as Class Types, where the built in members are from a different symbol provider, so if they are overriden, the overriden type info is used.



## Fixes bitwise operator typing
<!-- 2024-03-11 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1107 -->

Fixes #1103 


![image](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/assets/810290/48e41a4f-0b39-4f75-ba5f-394fcfcc056b)



## Prevent unused variable warnings on ternary and null coalescence expressions
<!-- 2024-03-13 (for v1.0.0-alpha.28 released on 2024-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1101 -->

Prevents unused variable warnings when transpiling ternary and null coalescence expressions if they include enums and constants.

Addresses: #1091 


## Fix transpile crash when token has no text
<!-- 2024-03-13 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1109 -->

Fix crash in during transpile when token is defined but doesn't have `text` (no idea how this happens, but better to prevent crashing)


## Increase max param count to 63
<!-- 2024-03-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1112 -->

Increases the max number of function parameters from 32 to 63, which seems to have been implemented in the Roku OS since OS 11.5 and above

## Added ArrayDefaultTypeReferenceType for when array symbol is not defined yet
<!-- 2024-03-14 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1111 -->

Needed to add a whole new ReferenceType for this use case!

Because the for-each-loop target was defined on a namespace, it wasn't defined yet at File-validation time (Namespaces are only defined at scope linking), so the default type was unknown.

Now that we have a reference type for this particular case, the array symbol can be defined in the future, and the for-each item will be automatically known.

## Add plugin hook for documentSymbol
<!-- 2024-03-19 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1116 -->

- Adds new plugin hooks for providing document symbols. 
- Migrates the logic out of `BrsFile` and into `BscPlugin`
- Adds a few missing document symbol entries
- Remove the leading namespace values from the symbols since they're shown in grey next to the symbols

**Before:**

Fixes https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/issues/385


## Upgade LSP packages
<!-- 2024-03-20 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1117 -->

Upgade to latest versions of the language server packages.


## More validation performance
<!-- 2024-03-20 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1110 -->

Refactors local variable checking to only check un-changed `AstSegment`s for function shadowing if those segments make an assignment to a symbol that changed.

Before:
```
validate@local   ---------- 51.368 ops/sec
validate@0.65.26 --------- 101.435 ops/sec
```

After: 
```
validate@local   --------- 286.331 ops/sec
validate@0.65.26 --------- 102.877 ops/sec
```


## Plugin hook provide workspace symbol
<!-- 2024-03-21 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1118 -->

Add plugin hook for `workspaceSymbol` support. 
Improve workspace symbols to include all types (interfaces, enums, etc).
Share this symbol discovery logic between document and workspace symbol requests.


## Significant Validation Improvement
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1119 -->

- Adds metrics for validation (link time and validation time)
- Refactored namespace linking to make better use of file-level caching
- Adds significant changes to how validation is performed:
  - Whole scopes are culled from validation if there are not changes that effect that immediate scope
  - Better file culling for name shadowing checks based on changed symbols


Overall, this should cut initial validation time down to about 40%, and *should* make validation changes in editor *much* faster...

## Improve workspace/document symbol handling
<!-- 2024-03-22 (for v0.65.27 released on 2024-03-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1120 -->

Refactored the workspace and document symbol logic to support AST walking. This will pave the way for adding more symbols in the future (like local variables, parameters, possibly even m assignments). That will come in a future PR


## Fix bug in range and position caching
<!-- 2024-03-28 (for v1.0.0-alpha.29 released on 2024-03-28), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1126 -->

Fixes an issue in `util.createRange()` and `util.createPosition()` where integers over 13 bits long would sometimes generate an incorrect cache key (thus returning the wrong cached value and wrong position/range values).

## Add `insertSpaceAfterConditionalCompileSymbol`, fix conditional compile formatting
<!-- 2024-03-07 (for v1.7.0 released on 2024-03-07), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript-formatter/pull/87 -->

Adds `insertSpaceAfterConditionalCompileSymbol` formatting option which will add a single space (`true`) or remove all whitespace (`false`) between the `#` and the following keyword. 

Also fixes indentation formatting related to conditional compile tokens that have spaces after the `#` (like `# if`, `# else if`, etc...).

Depends on https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/pull/1090
