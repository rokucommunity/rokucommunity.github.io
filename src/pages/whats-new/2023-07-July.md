## We need your help

The RokuCommunity projects are maintained by a relatively small group of developers (mostly volunteers), and we have a growing list of of unresolved issues. We need your help! There are many different ways you can contribute. Whether it's addressing bugs, improving documentation, introducing new features, or simply helping us manage our expanding list of GitHub issues, your involvement would be greatly appreciated. We are more than happy to guide you in finding the most suitable contribution method that aligns with your interests. To learn more about how you can contribute, feel free to reach out to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rokudevelopers/shared_invite/zt-4vw7rg6v-NH46oY7hTktpRIBM_zGvwA), or explore the existing GitHub issues:

## Issue of the month
In this section, we highlight a specific issue where we could benefit from the community's assistance in finding a solution. These problems are generally straightforward to address, and serve as an excellent opportunity to become acquainted with the RokuCommunity codebases.

This month, we'd like to draw attention to [brighterscript-formatter#23: Optional object comma](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/issues/23). brighterscript-formatter is the project that powers the auto code formatting in the vscode extension for both BrighterScript _and_ BrightScript code, so this feature will benefit every Roku developer, not just BrighterScript developers.

Commas in multiline object declarations are completely optional. Some teams prefer a trailing comma on every line to align the style with other languages like javascript or C#, while other teams prefer to omit the trailing commas because they're not necessary. The formatter needs to be updated to automaticaly add/remove the commas based on a configuration option. Perhaps something like this:

**aaCommaStyle: "trailing-required"**
```vb
someAA = {
   first: 1,
   second: 2,
   third: 3
}
```


**aaCommaStyle: "no-trailing"**
```vb
someAA = {
   first: 1
   second: 2
   third: 3
}
```
If you're interested in working on this feature, please comment on the [pull request](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/issues/475) or reach out to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rokudevelopers/shared_invite/zt-4vw7rg6v-NH46oY7hTktpRIBM_zGvwA)


# Editor

## Language server busy spinner
We've added a spinner in the vscode statusbar to let you know when the language server is busy. Features like completions or hovers have to wait until the project finishes validating, so seeing the spinner should raise awareness of _when_ validation is actually occurring, and roughly how long it takes. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/255330233-57736670-0c50-4629-83fa-401315d30b1e.gif)

NOTE: We've seen a few instances where the spinner never stops running. If this is happening for you, please raise [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/issues). 


## Improved BrighterScript interface Syntax highlighting
Users of BrighterScript interfaces will be pleased to know that we've fixed a few syntax highlighting bugs for comments and methods in interface declarations:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/244383770-6622a6f4-f550-4d9a-b608-97a7faf297a9.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/244383859-b3be286a-5008-4de6-bdc0-5250b8654e0a.png)

# Debugging

## New `fileLogging` option for debug sessions
We've added a new `launch.json` setting called `fileLogging`. Here's the default value:
```json
"fileLogging":{
	"dir": "${workspaceFolder}/logs",
	"rokuDevice": {
		"enabled": true,
		"filename": "rokuDevice.log",
		"mode": "session",
		"logLimit": 5
	},
	"debugger": {
		"enabled": true,
		"filename": "debugger.log",
		"mode": "session",
		"logLimit": 5
	}
}
``` 

`rokuDevice` is for the telnet/output logs from the Roku device. This is the output from all your print statements, Roku's beacon logs, compile timing, etc. 

`debugger` is for the RokuCommunity debug logging. These logs are typically used to help troubleshoot issues with our debugger logic in the VSCode extension. Turning on `logLevel: "verbose"` and submitting these debugger logs will really help us to more easily detect issues, so please consider submitting these logs when you open github issues.

The `"mode"` option specifies whether you want to generate a new log on every session. `"session"` means generate a new log every session, while `"append"` will append logs to the existing log file (or create a new one if it doesn't exist yet). You can also set `"logLimit"` to specify the max number of log files that should be created before the oldest one gets deleted. 


We've also deprecated the `logfilePath` and `brightscript.extensionLogfilePath` options in favor of this new, more powerful option. They'll still work for a while, but we suggest migrating to `fileLogging` as soon as you can. 

## delete channel before install option in `launch.json`

we now have a debugging option to always delete the existing developer channel before sideloading a new channel

option is called `deleteDevChannelBeforeInstall`

[#494](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/494)
[#158](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/158)


## support `SGRendezvous` through `ECP`

- Adds rendezvous tracking support via ECP

- Changes the way rendezvous tracking works by driving entirely based on a new `rendezvousTracking` boolean in `launch.json`

- Adds timeout safeguard for when ECP is too slow.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/250190134-9f7ae50b-95d6-4fd9-8166-beb9fe81839d.png)

[#150](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/150)

## fix rendezvous crash

Fixes [issue](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/issues/491) with the new rendezvous tracking that would crash the debug session during the startup flow

Seems that, if the compile times of the channel are long enough, Roku will reject sgrendezvous ECP requests during the compile flow. 

The fix is to just ignore failed http requests instead of crashing the entire debug session.

- Fix timing bugs during rendezvous tracking startup
- Only emit rendezvous data if new data was received

[#156](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/156)
 

# Formatting

# Language Features

## `beforeProgramDispose` interface created and exposed

we have created and exposed the `before program dispose (BeforeProgramDisposeEvent) ` interface

this allows code to perform cleanup even in the event of failure

[#844](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/844)
[#845](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/845)


## rendezvous tracking

We have added `launch.json` and `user settings` for `rendezvous tracking` which was introduced in `roku-debug@0.20.0` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/251153857-3b355507-49ec-4593-b276-0df77a857c19.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/251154017-997da317-4fd7-4ba1-b491-00b2bc0bc611.png)

[#490](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/490)


## afterScopeCreate event emitter

the event `afterScopeCreate` is fired now after the component is ready

[#843](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/843)



## bslint

improvements to `bslint` this month 

### add missing types

add `vscode-languageserver-types` to npm package.json which picks up extra types for validtion

[b623648](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/commit/b623648)

### `build.yml` tweak to tag `DIST_TAG=next` to tag as next release, rather than latest release

[78f1c71](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/commit/78f1c71)

### try .. catch .. bug fixed

Fixes a bug in trackCodeFlow where variables assigned in try/catch falsely trigger the "not all code paths assign..." error.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/253589414-f48da673-8af9-4e7d-a39d-02d90e2799c1.png)

[PR #93](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/93)

### performance boost by performing some lookups once in global scope only

rather than do multiple repeated lookups in local scope, perform some lookups once only in global scope

Fixes a bug in the varTracking logic that was re-calculating the globals too frequently (for each file for each scope). 

Since the globals are shared across every file in that scope, we can lift that calculation.

Here's some pseudocode of what changed.

before

```jsx
for (const scope of scopes) {
    for (const file of scope.files) {
        const globals = getAllGlobalNamesInScope(scope);
        validateFile(scope, file, globals);
    }
}
```

after

```jsx
for (const scope of scopes) {
    const globals = getAllGlobalNamesInScope(scope);
    for (const file of scope.files) {
        validateFile(scope, file, globals);
    }
}
```

This shaved off 1,300ms from the validation cycle of a large internal project

before

```
Validating project finished. (6s531.186ms)
```

after

```
Validating project finished. (5s224.474ms)
```

[PR #92](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/92)



### npm peer dependencies updated

updated npm peer dependencies

```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "brighterscript": ">= 0.66.0 < 1"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "brighterscript": ">= 0.66.0-alpha.1 < 1"
  },
```

mostly for testing, decouple loading from running by adding the `load` method to `ProgramBuilder`

[#821](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/821)

## property only highlighted in diagnostics

when a property cannot be found, the property only is highlighted, not the object it belongs to

before

after

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/244416204-8d7d046a-56c0-4da4-8cea-9dbb89559431.png)

[#821](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/821)



[#820](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/820)

## SymbolTypeFlag

renamed `SymbolTypeFlags` to `SymbolTypeFlag`

[#819](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/819)

## XML AST refactor

Refactors the XML AST to enable plugins to manipulate during transpile.

There's no noticeable performance hit for most things, but you can see a large boost in transpile performance for xml files!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/243781262-ae0f3326-5913-4365-9848-dedd578b7434.png)

## add `.kind` prop to `AstNode`

Adds a `.kind`` to `AstNode`

Adds an `AstNodeKind` enum

Converts the reflection methods to check for .kind instead of 

```jsx
thing?.constructor?.name === 'Whatever'
```

logic

Raw benchmarks show this as a fairly significant boost:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/234745941-ecf12cfd-cb6b-4755-8497-ac03817fb38c.png)

What that means in practice is validation speeds improve by 10-12 percent.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2544493/234746091-cacae55f-a825-4007-91da-23b26a4e0c7f.png)

***Downside - breaking change***

This is a breaking change, as all plugins that produce AST would need to be upgraded to the latest version of brighterscript in order to work with the version of brighterscript shipped with the vscode extension. 

Or, for example, latest version of brighterscript being used with a plugin that depends on an older version of brighterscript.

[#799](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/799)




## `v8-profiler-next` is now an `on-demand` install when running a profiling session

[Earlier work](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/pull/833) added the ability to run a profiling session with a single cli flag. However, it also brought with it a dependency on v8-profiler-next, which requires node-gyp to compile.

Since most bsc users won't be profiling the project, this PR moves that behind an on-demand install instead. 

That should help with nodejs compatibility and reduce npm install issues related to node-gyp.

[#854](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/854)


## functions as parameters

continued improvement when functions are used as parameters

- Fixes validations when a function is used as a parameter
- Validates non-functions passed as arguments
- Adds TypedFunctionType class for functions with known param types & return types

 [#853](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/853)

## allow `as Object` passing in the manner of `as Dynamic`

fixes issue with as object types of variables, they need to be allowed to be passed to any function type (just like dynamic).

[#850](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/850)

## pass `enums` as literal values

supports passing `enums` as their literal values eg string enum as a string

[#849](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/pull/849)


## various small fixes

assignment from return of member functions of primitive types

[#855](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/855)


using invalid as a default param value (now sets type to dynamic)

allows any variable to passed as argument to an untyped param with default type invalid

[#855](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/855)


adds Roku_Event_Dispatcher() global callable (from library Roku_Event_Dispatcher.brs)

[#855](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/855)


Fixes FormatJson() function signature (https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/language/global-utility-functions.md#formatjsonjson-as-object-flags--0-as-integer-as-string)

[#855](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/855)


## ongoing work with types and type validation

Remove enable type validation option 

[#846](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/846)

ongoing improvements to Types

[#783](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/783)
[#827](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/827)



## `0.66.0` performance fixes
