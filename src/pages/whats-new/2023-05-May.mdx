# Overview

This month has been a busy month with many small fixes going through in different parts of the Brightscript ecosystem.  

We have 

- upgraded a few items within the both code and scenegraph editors
- allowed an upgrade of http to use `postman-request` rather than `axios`
- added the ability to print out the full text of hex error codes when debugging, and also fixed a bug which crashes repeat debugging sessions 
- fixed several bugs in code signing, testing, logging and deploymnent
- upgrade npm libraries for `logger`, `postman-request` and `coveralls-next`


# Editor

## Code Colorization

## File History

Change rendezvous count for file history 

([#482](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/482))




## roku commands

fix Roku Commands list of available requests 

([#480](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/480))




# scenegraph 

We have improved `findChild` and `findAncestor` AstNode methods to support 

- externally cancelling the walk 

- enabling findAncestor to return a different node than matched, if the matcher returns the node

([#807](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/807))


We have also fixed an infinite recursion possibility in Scenegraph Inspector 

([#480](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/480))




# http `postman-request`

Since `postman-request` is a required dependency we are removing `axios` as it's a duplication of function

([#153](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/153))

We also fixed a runtime crash casued by removing `request` module - fixed by directly declaring `postman-request`

([#485](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/485))
([#151](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/151))




# debugging


## Render Text Meaning Of Error Codes

It is now possible to print out the full error text of error codes along with the hex short code 

for example, for hex error code `&h08` it is now possible to annotate with `(ERR_FC: invalid parameter passed to function/array (e.g neg matrix dim or square root))`

([#467](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/467))



## fix crash on subsequent debug session

We have fixed a bug where a subsequent debug session is finding the previous session is not cleared and so a 'file already exists' error hangs the debugger

([#152](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/152))






# deployment 


## pkg signing

This fixes a bug which overwrites the `signingPackage.pkg` file

([#114](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-deploy/pull/114))


## fix deployment tests
