## Link scopes during transpile, fixes namespace transpiling
<!-- 2024-08-03 (for v1.0.0-alpha.36 released on 2024-08-09), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1271 -->

Fixes a bug where certain namespaced function calls aren't transpiling properly. This was due to scope linking not being performed during the transpile process.

## `m` should be typed as roAssociativeArray for all inline functions
<!-- 2024-08-06 (for v1.0.0-alpha.36 released on 2024-08-09), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1272 -->

Example:

```
class Test
    sub method()
        stub = function()
            m.whatever = false ' m here is unknown - it is an AA
        end function
    end sub
end class
```






# Community Tools

## bslint
## Check if in TypeExpression before doing VariableExpression checks
<!-- 2024-07-26 (for v1.0.0-alpha.35 released on 2024-08-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/122 -->

Fixes #121 

Also fixes #117 


## Adds Name Shadowing lint rule
<!-- 2024-07-30 (for v1.0.0-alpha.35 released on 2024-08-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/124 -->

Addresses #99

Checks for name shadowing - that is, when a name in a namespace overrides an existing type/function.

## Updated to work with with Brighterscript v1.0.0-alpha.35
<!-- 2024-08-01 (for v1.0.0-alpha.35 released on 2024-08-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/125 -->

Mostly changes around the new structure of `BsDiagnsotic` ... 



## Removing peer-dependency because it keeps causing issues
<!-- 2024-08-01 (for v1.0.0-alpha.36 released on 2024-08-09), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/126 -->

Removing the peerDependency section in the package.json because I keep forgetting to update it when I cut releases, which causes issues. We've already established that you need to keep the alpha version of bslint in sync with brighterscript, that should be enough. 


## add rule for roRegex duplicates
<!-- 2024-08-06 (for v0.8.23 released on 2024-08-22), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/119 -->

## brighterscript@1.0.0-alpha.36
<!-- 2024-08-09 (for v1.0.0-alpha.36 released on 2024-08-09), ([1dea9d0](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/commit/1dea9d0)) -->




## Fix LINT3024 and LINT3025 case sensitivity bug
<!-- 2024-08-23 (for v0.8.24 released on 2024-08-23), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/bslint/pull/129 -->

Fix bug where LINT3024 and LINT3025 were doing a case-sensitive check when they should be checking case-insensitive. 


## ropm
## Maintenance (lint fixes, bsc upgrades, npm audit fixes)
<!-- 2024-08-01 (for v0.10.25 released on 2024-08-01), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/ropm/pull/75 -->
