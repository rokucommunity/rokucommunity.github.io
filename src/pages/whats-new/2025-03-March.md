# Editor
## added positive look back for double quotes to class roku builtin regex
<!-- 2025-02-26 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), ([52753bc](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/52753bc)) -->




## added unit tests against brightscript objects that should not be colorized
<!-- 2025-02-26 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), ([bdf4acd](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/bdf4acd)) -->




## Fix brightscript object syntax highlighting
<!-- 2025-02-26 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/623 -->

This Pull Request updates the brightscript grammar file; to only colorize brightscript objects that are an exact match & ignore all other. 

Ex: 
"roDateTime" is a successful match & should be colorized
"staging-roDateTime" is a failed match & should NOT be colorized

Change Breakdown:
- Updates the `class_roku_builtin` regex with a positive look back for double quotes.
- Adds unit tests to ensure ro objects that are NOT an identical match are not colorized.

Fixes #622 


## Added snippet for functional fields
<!-- 2025-02-26 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), ([e8def2f](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/e8def2f)) -->




## Update snippets/xml.json
<!-- 2025-02-26 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), ([9d1053f](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/9d1053f)) -->

<!-- 2025-02-26 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/625 -->




## update syntax highlighting regex to include list of all known brightscript & brightsign components
<!-- 2025-02-27 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), ([7ed858a](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/7ed858a)) -->




## updated unit tests for testRokuClass to include all brightscript & brightsign components
<!-- 2025-02-27 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), ([2e32433](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/2e32433)) -->




## syntax highlighting updates to include all known brightscript & brightsign components 
<!-- 2025-02-27 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/626 -->

This update provides the `class_roku_builtin`  regex with a comprehensive list of all brightscript & brightsign components for highlighting. All values have been inserted in their raw format for legibility & easier maintenance going forward.

All brightsign components were sourced from the following link:
https://brightsign.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/370672721/Language+Reference


## Reenable the `deferScopeLoading` launch option now that the underlying crash has been fixed
<!-- 2025-03-10 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), ([db0d7bd](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/db0d7bd)) -->




## Reenable the `enhanceREPLCompletions` launch option
<!-- 2025-03-10 (for v2.55.6 released on 2025-03-10), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/630 -->

Reenable the `deferScopeLoading` launch option now that the underlying crash has been fixed. 


## Inverted keys `PageUp` and `PageDown` mapping on remote control mode
<!-- 2025-03-15 (for v2.55.8 released on 2025-03-17), ([5e2c7ca](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/5e2c7ca)) -->




## Inverted keys `PageUp` and `PageDown` mapping on remote control mode
<!-- 2025-03-15 (for v2.55.8 released on 2025-03-17), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/631 -->

When using the remote control mode the navigation keys `PageUp` and `PageDown` were mapped to `FF` and `Rewind` respectively, that causes inverted behavior when navigating in `LabelList` and `CheckList` nodes for instance, when you press `PageDown` instead of going down in the list it goes up.

This PR inverts the behavior to be in the way any user would expect.



# Debugging

## Fixed and issue where hasFocus and isInFocusChain virtual vars where missing on nodes
<!-- 2025-02-26 (for v0.21.25 released on 2025-03-10), ([7f9d220](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/7f9d220)) -->




## Fixed and issue where hasFocus and isInFocusChain virtual vars where missing on nodes
<!-- 2025-02-26 (for v0.21.25 released on 2025-03-10), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/234 -->




## Fix crash in bsc project when thread has error
<!-- 2025-03-04 (for v0.21.25 released on 2025-03-10), ([ecf18f0](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/ecf18f0)) -->




## Fix crash in bsc project when thread has error
<!-- 2025-03-04 (for v0.21.25 released on 2025-03-10), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/235 -->

Gracefully recover whenever the bsc project worker thread crashes (instead of bringing down the entire process...).

The fix was to observer the `.on('error'` event from the worker thread. But then also, when we reject a deferred, if nobody is listening then that will _also_ crash node so we need to immediately observer the rejection and ignore the error. 


## Fixed TelnetAdapter reporting that it was a protocol adapter
<!-- 2025-03-17 (for v0.21.27 released on 2025-03-17), ([cf69d5e](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/cf69d5e)) -->




## Fixed TelnetAdapter reporting that it was a protocol adapter
<!-- 2025-03-17 (for v0.21.27 released on 2025-03-17), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/237 -->




## Fixed some dup var names on datetime
<!-- 2025-03-19 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), ([883cc3f](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/883cc3f)) -->




## Fixed some dup var names on datetime
<!-- 2025-03-19 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/239 -->




## optimized the caching of consumers in sorce map manager
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), ([a31debb](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/a31debb)) -->




## Added the ability to ask the BscProject for a scope range
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), ([957ab68](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/957ab68)) -->




## Some shutdown fixes
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), ([ebec434](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/ebec434)) -->




## Some helpers to deal with client to debugger and back line and columns
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), ([a3c5f61](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/a3c5f61)) -->




## Added the logic to set the scope range and some line and column conversion in getClosestCompletionDetails
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), ([c6ee0fe](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/c6ee0fe)) -->




## Unit test fixes
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), ([45af616](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/commit/45af616)) -->




## Limit the range of scopes
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.21.28 released on 2025-03-20), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/roku-debug/pull/240 -->

Improves the `scopes` request to limit to only the closest function body of the current line. This significantly improves the inline variables presentation during debug sessions. Here's a quick example: 

**Before:**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b71313c1-8cde-4282-9208-8911f86fdfdc)

**After:** (notice the variables in init no longer have inline variable highlights)

# BrighterScript

## Backport v1 typecast syntax to v0
<!-- 2025-03-05 (for v0.69.2 released on 2025-03-13), ([f7be778b](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/f7be778b)) -->




## Prevent running the lsp project in a worker thread
<!-- 2025-03-07 (for v0.69.1 released on 2025-03-10), ([65ac23a9](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/65ac23a9)) -->




## Fix package-lock.json
<!-- 2025-03-07 (for v0.69.1 released on 2025-03-10), ([da2ea63c](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/da2ea63c)) -->




## Fix error in deps
<!-- 2025-03-07 (for v0.69.1 released on 2025-03-10), ([37afbd90](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/37afbd90)) -->




## Safer async try/catch for worker pool disposal
<!-- 2025-03-10 (for v0.69.1 released on 2025-03-10), ([0a7826b9](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/0a7826b9)) -->




## Prevent running the lsp project in a worker thread
<!-- 2025-03-10 (for v0.69.1 released on 2025-03-10), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1423 -->

If you tried to use the brighterscript library in a worker_thread in any capacity, it would always try to run a new project on startup. But should only do that if we actually want to run the project itself via the language server. So added a runtime arg to further restrict when that code activates. 


## Backport v1 typecast syntax to v0
<!-- 2025-03-10 (for v0.69.2 released on 2025-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1421 -->

Parses and then ignores any use of the typecast statement, eg.

```
typecast m as SomeInterface
```


Addresses #1416


## Significantly improve the performance of standardizePath
<!-- 2025-03-11 (for v0.69.2 released on 2025-03-13), ([aa891fbe](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/aa891fbe)) -->




## Bump @babel/runtime from 7.24.5 to 7.26.10
<!-- 2025-03-12 (for v0.69.2 released on 2025-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1426 -->

Bumps [@babel/runtime](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-runtime) from 7.24.5 to 7.26.10.

## Add unit tests and windows optimization
<!-- 2025-03-13 (for v0.69.2 released on 2025-03-13), ([c6c936aa](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/c6c936aa)) -->




## Significantly improve the performance of standardizePath
<!-- 2025-03-13 (for v0.69.2 released on 2025-03-13), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1425 -->

Significant speedup to the standardizePath function. 

These numbers are smaller than real-world because we actually test using 12 strings instead of 1 (so we could test a variety of patterns).  The gains should theoretically be much greater for individual calls. 

Also, we added caching for the path, so once we've seen a path to standardize, we can skip all the work and just return the result from last time.

## Adds Alias statement syntax from v1 to v0
<!-- 2025-03-15 (for v0.69.3 released on 2025-03-20), ([977578aa](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/977578aa)) -->




## Remove temporary code that was accidentally committed
<!-- 2025-03-17 (for v0.69.3 released on 2025-03-20), ([183fe8d6](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/183fe8d6)) -->




## Remove temporary code that was accidentally committed
<!-- 2025-03-17 (for v0.69.3 released on 2025-03-20), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1432 -->

Removes some temporary code that was accidentally committed to the project.

Discovered by @iBicha https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/pull/993#pullrequestreview-2688746483


## Adds Alias statement syntax from v1 to v0
<!-- 2025-03-17 (for v0.69.3 released on 2025-03-20), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1430 -->

Makes the alias statement syntax used in v1 acceptable in v0, but then ignores it and doesn't do anything. It is empty in transpiles.


## Fxied a bug where getClosestExpression would return the last expression in a file in position was missing
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.69.3 released on 2025-03-20), ([ae5b2d14](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/ae5b2d14)) -->




## Fixed getClosestExpression bug to return undefined when position not found
<!-- 2025-03-20 (for v0.69.3 released on 2025-03-20), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1433 -->

Fixed a bug in `BrsFile.getClosestExpression()` that was returning the last expression in the AST when given an undefined position. Now we return `undefined` if the position or position.line is undefined, which should make more sense and also save a little processing time because we can exit early instead of traversing the entire AST tree


## Pass version to plugin factory
<!-- 2025-03-27 (for v0.69.4 released on 2025-03-31), ([15ad02f6](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/15ad02f6)) -->




## Fix some class docs bugs
<!-- 2025-03-27 (for v0.69.4 released on 2025-03-31), ([e62e5d08](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/e62e5d08)) -->




## remove .only
<!-- 2025-03-28 (for v0.69.4 released on 2025-03-31), ([ef875a8a](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/ef875a8a)) -->




## Add optional chain to doc example to prevent older bsc version crashes
<!-- 2025-03-28 (for v0.69.4 released on 2025-03-31), ([a0070e05](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/a0070e05)) -->




## Support plugin factory detecting brighterscript version
<!-- 2025-03-28 (for v0.69.4 released on 2025-03-31), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1438 -->

Provide plugin factories with the bsc version. This will allow plugins to determine which features to support, or even load completely separate plugins for v0 and v1. 

Here are the docs on this feature: https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/blob/plugin-factory-version/docs/plugins.md#brighterscript-v1-compatability

Also fixed a small docs bug in classes.md (it came for free when updating the plugin docs)

<!-- 2025-03-31 (for v0.69.4 released on 2025-03-31), ([7549d96d](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/7549d96d)) -->

## Task/impliment default callback handlers
<!-- 2025-03-24 (for v0.6.0 released on 2025-03-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/promises/pull/30 -->

Support calling `.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()` (and their on* counterparts) without any callbacks, which result in passthrough code. See [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) for how it works in javascript, we are mimicking that same behavior. 

For example:
```
'this .then and .catch are essentially noops that behave like they weren't defined in the first place.
promises.chain(somePromise).then().catch()
