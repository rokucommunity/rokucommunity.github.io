## Fix Roku Device View by upgrading to RTA with patch to use postman-request for screenshot triggering
<!-- 2024-09-19 (for v2.49.1 released on 2024-09-19), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/589 -->




## Fix create-vsix
<!-- 2024-09-23 (for v2.50.0 released on 2024-09-23), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/590 -->

Fix create-vsix by upgrading to upload-artifact@v4


## Adds ability to install a missing bsc version
<!-- 2024-09-23 (for v2.50.0 released on 2024-09-23), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/583 -->

Adds the ability to install brighterscript versions automatically without requiring it to exist in `${workspaceFolder}/node_modules`.

1. After this PR, the bsdk value can support the following values:

    - an absolute path to a preinstalled version of brighterscript (i.e. `C:/roku/brighterscript`)
    - a relative path to a preinstalled version of brighterscript (i.e. `./node_modules/brighterscript`)
    - an exact version of brighterscript from the npm registry (i.e. `0.67.6`, `1.0.0-alpha.36`)
    - an absolute path to a `.tgz` file (i.e. `C:/downloads/brighterscript-0.67.6.tgz`)
    - a relative path to a `.tgz` file (i.e. `./packages/brighterscript-0.67.6.tgz`)
    - a URL to a .tar file (i.e. `npm install https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript/releases/download/v0.67.6/brighterscript-0.67.6.tgzz`)

2. We've added a new setting called `npmCacheRetentionDays` which determines how long to wait before deleting unused brighterscript versions from the local cache. 
3. Added a new command called `clearNpmPackageCache` which will clear all downloaded brighterscript packages
4. Added a new series of menu options for downloading brighterscript versions, and also a few maintenance items like opening the install directory or clearing the downloaded files

Here's a demo of the feature in action:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b09ad5-a5a0-46f3-b960-81f296d962db




TODO:

- [x] add menu item/command to clear all cached versions
- [x] delete bsc versions that are older than 45 days (make this configurable)
- [x] add `vscode.window.onDidChangeWindowState` event to mark a bsc version's "last used date"
- [x] show all npm versions in the dropdown
- [x] show mainline and prerelease versions in separate menus
- [x] verify the extension storage gets cleaned up on extension uninstall (there's no way to do this, it's probably fine?)


## Fix crashes where workspaceFolders was undefined
<!-- 2024-09-26 (for v2.50.2 released on 2024-09-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/593 -->

Fix several spots where workspaceFolders was not being safely accessed, since it can sometimes be `undefined`.

Originally reported in #588 


## Fix lsp missing crash
<!-- 2024-09-26 (for v2.50.2 released on 2024-09-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/594 -->

Fix crash when the local node_modules language server couldn't be loaded. It works again.

Also updated the error message to be more concise, helping to remind people to run `npm install` and moving the path to the end of the message (since most people don't read the path anyway...)


## Merge pull request #595 from rokucommunity/master2
<!-- 2024-09-27 (for v2.50.2 released on 2024-09-27), ([310f19f](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/commit/310f19f)) -->




## Consistent device list sorting and formatting.
<!-- 2024-09-27 (for v2.50.3 released on 2024-09-27), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/pull/596 -->

- Ensure the device lists are sorted in a deterministic way.
- unify the formatting of the device list to provide more useful information

# Debugging


# BrighterScript

## Include missing transpiled comments
<!-- 2024-08-13 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1278 -->

Fixes several issues where comments were being missed when transpiling. Specifically around annotations above statements, and namespaced function calls.

Fixes #1274


## Add plugin naming convention
<!-- 2024-08-15 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1284 -->

Adds docs outlining our plugin naming conventions


## Added tests and fixes around transpiling variables that shadow stuff
<!-- 2024-08-15 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1282 -->

Addresses #1277 

Fixes transpilation issues with variables that shadow things in namespaces.

Basically, "closest thing wins"

If a variable or function param shadows a const, enum, etc. then it does not do any special transpilation, but instead uses it as-is.

However, there are still diagnostics for when a variable shadows a non-namespaced function or class, because using those still lead to un-defined behaviour.

eg:

```
sub foo()
end sub

sub bar()
  foo = 1 ' this shadows the function above
  print foo ' this could lead to un-defined behaviour
end sub
```


however, if the function or class IS in a namespace, then itâ€™s okay, because the transpilation will change the name:
```
namespace alpha
  sub foo()
  end sub

  sub bar()
    foo = 1 
    print foo
  end sub
end namespace
```
transpiles to:

```
sub alpha_foo()
end sub

sub alpha_bar()
  foo = 1  
  print foo
end sub
```

because of transpilation of the namespace, `foo` no longer shadows the function, so it is OK


## Handles diagnostic with invalid location, and semantic tokens for unscoped file
<!-- 2024-08-19 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1286 -->

Fixes #1275

Also, if there was a BrsFile that was unscoped, like in `/components` but not included in a component, the Language server would crash in the semantic tokens parser when trying to link a scope




## Eliminate FunctionExpression.functionStatement
<!-- 2024-08-20 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1287 -->

Addresses #1283 




## Merges `ExitForStatement` and `ExitWhileStatement`
<!-- 2024-08-21 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1289 -->

There's a bit of weirdness here because `exitwhile` is an accepted statement, but `exitfor` is not.

Addresses #1285


## Add support for roIntrinsicDouble
<!-- 2024-08-23 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1291 -->

Fixes bug for missing known datatype `roIntrinsicDouble`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9e41643-2318-417e-82d1-076cdcc65a5b)



## Add support for resolving sourceRoot at time of config load
<!-- 2024-08-23 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1290 -->

Add bsconfig value for resolving the `sourceRoot` at time of loading the config. 


## Adds support for types declared in comments
<!-- 2024-09-23 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1293 -->

Adds ability to define variable types in comments:
 - `@param {type}` for function params
 - `@return {type}` for function return type
 - `@type {type}` and `@type {type} varName` for variables in functions


## Fix some null crashes
<!-- 2024-09-23 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1304 -->

Fix a few crashes related to diagnostics having null location or uri properties. No idea how these happen, but it's still better to not crash.


## Lock in github action versions
<!-- 2024-09-25 (for v1.0.0-alpha.37 released on 2024-09-25), ([95eba693](https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/commit/95eba693)) -->




## Ast node clone
<!-- 2024-09-25 (for v0.67.7 released on 2024-09-25), https://github.com/RokuCommunity/brighterscript/pull/1281 -->

Add `.clone()` method to AstNode and BscType objects. This will make for much easier duplication of template code for plugins. 

- [x] add `.clone()` method to `Statement`s
- [x] add `.clone()` method to `Expression`s
- [x] add `.clone()` method to `BscType`s
- [x] add unit tests
